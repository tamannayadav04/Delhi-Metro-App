Delhi Metro Route Finder 🚇
This project simulates the Delhi Metro route system, allowing users to plan metro journeys quickly and accurately.

Users can:

✅ Find the shortest route between two stations using Dijkstra’s algorithm
✅ View total distance, fare, and metro line information
✅ Interact with a clean and responsive web interface to explore the metro map

🌟 Features
🔍 Route Finder: Enter source and destination stations to get the shortest path
🗺️ Metro Line Guidance: Each segment shows the corresponding metro line
📏 Distance Calculation: Total kilometers are displayed for your trip
💸 Fare Estimator: Get the fare using: ₹10 base + ₹2/km
📊 Network View: Full graph of the metro network rendered in a readable format
💻 Fully Client-side: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
🖼️ Responsive UI: Mobile-friendly and optimized for various screen sizes
📂 Modular Code: Separated files for map rendering, data handling, and styling
🧠 Algorithms Used
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
Accounts for multiple paths, selecting the one with the minimum total distance.
Tracks metro line transitions and segments clearly.
